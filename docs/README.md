## Quick Start

For a quick overview of the key concepts:

1. Start with [01-dots-concepts.md](01-dots-concepts.md) to understand the fundamentals
2. Review [02-architecture-patterns.md](02-architecture-patterns.md) for voxel-specific design patterns
3. Check [09-development-roadmap.md](09-development-roadmap.md) for a structured approach to development

## Target Audience

This knowledge base is intended for:
- Unity developers familiar with C# but new to DOTS
- Experienced developers looking to optimize voxel engines
- Technical leads planning voxel-based projects
- Students researching advanced Unity techniques

## Performance Expectations

Using DOTS for voxel engines can provide:
- **10-100x performance improvements** over traditional GameObject approaches
- **Better memory efficiency** through data-oriented design
- **Scalable architecture** for large voxel worlds
- **Multi-threaded processing** with minimal effort
